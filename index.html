        <div id=tdes>Tell us a little about<br>yourself or your family<br>or your hobbies.</div>
        <div id=line></div>
        <div id=spara>a. I have a masters in mathematics with a specialty in statistics; I worked in the computer industry; I've worked in<br>education as an Academic Dean; I worked at Cape Kennedy during the Apollo Program for three months and the<br>Skylab Program for three months. My name is on the monuments dedicated to the Spaceworker's Hall of Fame. I<br> worked with Broadway legend, Ann Reinking, for 15 years. We created world renowned Broadway Theatre Project,<br> which is a training school for those who wish to perhaps have a career on Broadway. They are taught by the best in<br>the business from Broadway and Hollywood. In addition to this, I was Ann's Assistant Choreographer on Chicago<br>and Fosse on Broadway. I worked on all national and international tours. With Fosse, I eventually became the<br>Director/Choreographer of the International Tour. I was the Associate Choreographer on Look of Love at<br>Roundabout Theatre and a number of other projects.<br>b. My father was a mechanical engineer for IBM at Cape Kennedy. He was known as a very valuable member of the<br>launch team. He found an error in one of the capsules and as a result of bringing it to the attention of all he won the<br>highest award a space worker can be awarded. His name is on all of the monuments at the Spaceworkers Walk of<br>Fame. My mother was simply the strongest and most admirable woman to have as one's mother.</div>

        <div>Who is your fashion<br>inspiration<br><span>I do not have any one person who inspires<br>me fashion-wise. I have my own style<br>dictated by what turns me on when I am<br>shopping. I tend toward the unconventional.<br>The style that I find most appealing is that of<br>Issey Miyake.</span></div>
        <div>What is a top fashion<b>trend for you in 2021?<span>flowing maxi dresses that are flowered;<br>flowing shirts with loose sleeves; anything<br>Miyake.</span></div>
        <div><span>If none, what is your position on<br>how you express yourself through<br>fashion?</span><br><span>I have enough pieces of odd bits of tops and bottoms that I am able to put together<br>outfits that show that I am not conservative but most likely dabble in an artistic field.</span></div>
        <div><span>Do you feel there is a link between our<br>way to express ourselves via fashion<br>and women empowerment</span><br><span>I feel that the ability for a woman to choose to dress the way she wishes to for a particular<br>event indicates empowerment. When there is a business party and all of the women show up<br>in conservative pants and tops, it shows me that a 'costume' has been assigned and that has<br>been dictated by their job place or that of their mates. It shows lack of empowerment. I would<br>wear what I wanted to wear.</span></div>
        <div><span>What do you personally think<br>about women empowerment as<br>a movement and what it means<br>for you?</span><br><span>I have always had to deal with fighting for power for women. Given that I worked toward a<br>Masters in Mathematics in the early 70's, my classes were very small and the number of<br>women never exceeded 3. When I worked at the Cape, my manager once slapped me on the<br>backside. When I worked in education, my superior once said, I wish I could take you on a slow<br>boat to China. There was really no one to go to about these things at that time but there was<br>certainly a way to handle it. You simply cooled your heels when it came to being in the<br>presence of that person. You cooled your attitude, also, not to the point of rudeness, however. I<br>tell students I teach that when it comes to the casting couch - LOSE THE JOB! by walking out!<br>You have the power. </span></div>
        <div><span>Can you share your<br>story And experience<br>with aumi4?</span><br><span>I do not have any one person who inspires me fashion-wise. I<br>have my own style dictated by what turns me on when I am<br>shopping. I tend toward the unconventional. The style that I find<br>most appealing is that of Issey Miyake.</span></div>
        <div>What other products would you like to see in our<br>store. We will be very happy to bring you<br>something to be a fan about. What will it be?<br></div>
        <br><div>I would love to see jewelry in your store. Just as your bags are not typical, I think your jewelry<br>should be off the beaten trail. It should be excellent quality but affordable (is that possible?)</div>
